# CollegeAddmissionApplication

As part of this project, we developed an online college admission system for United College that is crucial to both the institution and students and makes the process simple as opposed to the manual admission method, which takes a lot of time and results in lengthy lines. By bringing the admissions process online in this high-tech era, we are cutting down on the physical labour and added time required. Students can fill out the admission applications and register in the system. Additionally, a notification on the applicants who accepted the admission is shown on the window. After the application is submitted successfully, the student should get a confirmation email. Staff can login and reject/accept the application
